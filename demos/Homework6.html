        My name is Jovana Mitic, and I am a junior majoring in Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science and Data 
        Science at Converse University. I chose Girls Who Code because I wanted to get young girls into coding, which was 
        something I was not introduced while growing up. I also wante to be part of the community of strong, intelligent, and supporting
        women who are making a difference and closing a gender gap.
